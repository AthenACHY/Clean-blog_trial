Vegan runner self biography of transformations into an animal advocate.
======

Alex's writing is a honest account of how he found his place in animal activism with a vivid description of his emotional conflicts on a lot of decisions he made on his way.

I liked that he gave us a background on his veggie life style in chapter one, that it was just a reaction to the meat eating culture of his family. The transformative point came into him seeing the picture of the pig babe escaping from the truck destined to a slaughter house. He felt a connection with babe that she is more than an animal live to serve us as meat but she has her own mind and desires, to freedom. 

He then realize that these non-humans are not that far away from us, it is the cultural narrative that strips them from their personhood, even bodies, leaving us with a piece of fillet. This is so disconnected from a body that allow us to forget that these animals also have a sensational body and deserve autonomy.

He then moved on to why the culture construct was so successful in hiding the side of living breathing animals and why it is necessary so. He reason that many people cannot stand the level of suffering of these animals, so it is easier to turn away and disconnect or even feel uncontrollable anger when this issue is brought up. These are emotions that cover up the intrinsic fears, of cruelty and mortality. 

And Alex, through participating in various forms  animal activism, thinks that there has to be another way to make people care, care enough to take actions. He found incredible solace in volunteering in animal sanctuaries and vigils to witness the pig on their way to be slaughtered. It is an action of 'seen seen': the activists see the animals and the animals see them. It is a form of mutual witness that bring us closer to nature and humble us to extend our compassion to other life forms. 

This deep awakening is the key to his soul searching journey that he found his calling as a storyteller to bring animals closer to people, as equal individuals with personalities; and to bring human closer to the animals, as a confessing friend that wanted to make a change but was confounded by the environment. By admitting the vulnerability and faults, people will have strength and seek helps and shifting direction. Because there were a lot of guilts and judgment is traditional animal activism, Alex sought to find a more comforting way to promote changes. This is beautifully done in his advocacy short film 73 cows.

It is a truly inspirational book, not only about animal activism, but also about how a person face and act upon a sheering amount of sufferings, at emotional, intellectual, and physical levels.
