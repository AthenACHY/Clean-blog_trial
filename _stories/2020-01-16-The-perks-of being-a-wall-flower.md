An honest account of finding true friends.
======

Picked it up last week in the library. Well, i usually avoided the fiction section but i turned to it when i didn't find anything interesting. I was curious how the book was like as i didn't watch the movie but i knew it was a good story.

It is actually very, very good. I would never imagine getting so much into a series of one-sided letters written by Charlie. And it is kind of relatable, even though i did not have the american high-school life. There were still a period of obsessive music listening, hanging out with friends, and smoking and drinking that kind of stupid things. The truly genuine part was Charlie and Sam and Patrick and Bob and all the friends gathered and become so invincible. Thats made me smile; it was big time one think friendship is so great and time with these great companions went like a blur.

Chobosky handled Charlie story with a lot of tenderness and made the heartbroken events sad but soft, concordant with Charlie sensitivity. Aunt Helen's sudden death, Patrick struggle to come out, his sister Janet's abortion... But then also there were all these beautiful happy part of making new friends, Bill mentorship, first date, graduations. I "participated" with Charlie in his life on all the sad and happy things and somehow it reminded me of my own 20s. The time that I was fooling around and felt so alive. 

Through the blend of good and bad things happened around Charlie, Chobosky wrote about his panicked, seeking advices, dealt with the issues and broke down. It is very endearing to see how he try to do his best and always want people to be happy. Thats very kind. It was about understanding and keep our mouth shut in the right time, which is desperately needed in our time. 

And finally in the last letter, he has grew a sense of composure to know that he would be fine, he would make it through. I was truly happy for him, because thats probably what I have recently learnt to do after many many practices, mental preparation, and rewriting my story actively. 

There were also a lot of life lessons and powerful quotes in the book. Sometimes I wonder US high-schoolers seem to go through a lot of adult situations; my uneventful life can easily take 10 more years to do through this kind of relationshit compared to what happened to them in 2-3 years. 

### The quotes I like 

"We accept the live we think we deserve"

"I would die for you but i wont live for you"

### And the poem in the book:

Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines<br/>
he wrote a poem<br/>
And called it "Chops" Because that was the name of his dog<br/>
And that's what it was all about<br/>
And his teacher gave him an A<br/>
and a gold star<br/>
And his mother hung it on the kitchen door<br/>
and read it to his aunts<br/>
That was the year Father Tracy<br/>
took all the kids to the zoo<br/>
And he let them sing on the bus<br/>
And his little sister was born<br/>
with tiny toenails and no hair<br/>
And his mother and father kissed a lot<br/>
And the girl around the corner sent him a<br/>
Valentine signed with a row of X's<br/>
and he had to ask his father what the X's meant<br/>
And his father always tucked him in bed at night<br/>
And was always there to do it<br/>

Once on a piece of white paper with blue lines<br/>
he wrote a poem<br/>
And he called it "Autumn"<br/>
because that was the name of the season<br/>
And that's what it was all about<br/>
And his teacher gave him an A<br/>
and asked him to write more clearly<br/>
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door<br/>
because of its new paint<br/>
And the kids told him<br/>
that Father Tracy smoked cigars<br/>
and left butts on the pews<br/>
And sometimes they would burn holes<br/>
That was the year his sister got glasses<br/>
with thick lenses and black frames<br/>
And the girl around the corner laughed<br/>
when he asked her to go see Santa Claus<br/>
And the kids told him why<br/>
his mother and father kissed a lot<br/>
And his father never tucked him in bed at night<br/>
And his father got mad<br/>
when he cried for him to do it<br/>

Once on a paper torn from his notebook<br/>
he wrote a poem<br/>
And he called it "Innocence: A Question"<br/>
because that was the question about his girl<br/>
And that's what it was all about<br/>
And his professor gave him an A<br/>
and a strange steady look<br/>
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door<br/>
because he never showed her<br/>
That was the year that Father Tracy died<br/>
And he forgot how the end<br/>
of the Apostle's Creed went<br/>
And he caught his sister<br/>
making out on the back porch<br/>
And his mother and father never kissed<br/>
or even talked<br/>
And the girl around the corner<br/>
wore too much makeup<br/>
That made him cough when he kissed her<br/>
but he kissed her anyway<br/>
because that was the thing to do<br/>
And at three A.M. he tucked himself into bed<br/>
his father snoring soundly<br/>

That's why on the back of a brown paper bag<br/>
he tried another poem<br/>
And he called it "Absolutely Nothing"<br/>
Because that's what it was really all about<br/>
And he gave himself an A<br/>
and a slash on each damned wrist<br/>
And he hung it on the bathroom door<br/>
because this time he didn't think<br/>
he could reach the kitchen<br/>

I liked that they mentioned vapour trail and i will listen to Asleep by the Smiths.
