<p>I am a trying to be bioinformatician. Typically I read papers and wonder how people pull out all these amazing analyses. So the only way to find out is to DIY again, using their data and methods. I fail numerous times; sometimes I succeed.</p>

<p>This a blog about trails and errors; all the failing forwards to work with big-data to solve biological questions. </p>
